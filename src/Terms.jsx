By using such features, or any part thereof, you agree to be bound by the Additional Terms applicable to such features. In the event that any of the Additional Terms governing such area conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms will govern.</p>
            <h2>4.  Use of Our Service and Accounts</h2>
            <p>We provide resume and curriculum vitae building, document storage services, resume database and other resume and career enhancement tools. For as long as you agree to these Terms and abide by them, you may use the Service. These Terms apply to all Users of the Service, including Visitors, Registered Users and Subscribers.</p>
            <p>(a) Visitors: Visitors may browse the Site in accordance with these Terms, but will not have full access to the Service (which may include but are not limited to contributing content, downloading tools, posting comments or signing up for special programs) without first becoming “Registered Users”.</p>
            <p>(b) Registered Users and Accounts: In order to access certain features of the Service you may be required to become a Registered User. A “Registered User” is a User who has registered an account with us (your “Account”) or who has a valid account on the social networking service (“SNS”) through which the User has connected to the Service (each such account, a “Third-Party Account”). As a Registered User, you will have access to view your documents, but will not be able to edit, print, or  download them unless you are a Subscriber.</p>
            <p>(c) Subscribers. Users that have entered in an agreement with Provider to receive additional access in order to, modify, print, download, and share their resume and/or cover letter as well as make use of additional Site offerings are considered subscribers (“Subscriber”). Subscriber offers may vary from time to time. Please review the information included in your purchase order confirmation email and/or contact our Customer Service team if you have any questions. You will need to be a Registered User first in order to be able to purchase a subscription and be considered a Subscriber.</p>
            <p>(d) Registration Data: In registering for the Service, you agree to (i) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration form (the “Registration Data”); and (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You may not share your Account or password with anyone, and you agree to (A) notify Provider immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security at support@bold.com; and (B) exit from your Account at the end of each session. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Provider has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Provider has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). Provider shall be entitled to monitor your username and password and, at its discretion, require you to change it. If you use a username and password that Provider considers insecure, Provider will be entitled to require this to be changed and/or terminate your Account. Provider reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to, claims by a third party that a username violates the third party’s rights. You agree not to register for an Account on behalf of an individual other than yourself, or register for an Account on behalf of any group or entity unless you are authorized to bind such person, group or entity to these Terms (see “Shared Accounts” below). By registering another person, group or entity you hereby represent that you are authorized to do so.</p>
            <p>(e) Access through Social Networking Sites: If you access the Service through an SNS as part of the functionality of the Service, you may link your Account with Third-Party Accounts, by allowing Provider to access your Third-Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Provider and/or grant Provider access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Provider to pay any fees or making Provider subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Provider access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Provider may access, make available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Provider internet properties that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (“SNS Content”) so that it is available on and through the Provider internet properties via your Account. Unless otherwise specified in the Terms, all SNS Content shall be considered to be your User Content (as defined in Section 5) for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your Account on the Provider internet properties. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Provider’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Provider internet properties. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your Third-Party Accounts at any time by accessing the “Settings” section of the Service. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. Provider makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or non-infringement, and Provider is not responsible for any SNS Content.</p>
            <p>(f) Product Development: From time to time and in an effort of optimizing the User experience, Provider may develop multiple Site experiences and A/B test multiple factors such as Site performance, User preferences, new tools and services, among others.  These A/B tests may not be the same for every customer and may not be available every time. Certain tests may fail and may show errors through the Site. If you have any issues or concerns, please call our Customer Service for support. </p>
            <h2>5. Your Content and Your License to Us</h2>

When you create an Account or provide career information on or through the Service (including via forms available on the Site or by uploading a resume) you agree that you are solely responsible for the accuracy of your User Content. You agree that Provider may also offer information and other proprietary content that is of most interest to you.</p>
            <p>You may choose to make some of your User Content public on the Service. For some of our features, other members may be able to request email notifications of your new public User Content or publish their own comments to your comments. We may use the public User Content to improve our service, make connections with potential employers, personalize site views, market services, promote or show you other career building services or tools, and identify or feature popular members.</p>
            <p>For clarity, you retain ownership of your User Content at all times. However, by posting, uploading and/or Making Available any User Content within the Service, and/or by providing any communication or material to Provider, you automatically:</p>
            <p>(a) Grant Provider a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable through multiple tiers, and transferable, license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Content in connection with the Service and Provider' (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or later developed). We may modify or adapt your User Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your User Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations within the Service, or of any networks, devices, services or media; including, but not limited, to structured data markups for content ratings. You also hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your public User Content, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) the above licenses granted by you in User Content you submit to the Service will survive even if you remove or delete your User Content from the Service and, (ii) the above licenses granted by you in forum comments, testimonials or submissions you submit are perpetual and irrevocable. Except with respect to your User Content, you agree that you have no right or title in or to any other content or Materials (see Section 11 below) that appears on or in the Service, including, but not limited to any information associated with another Account or user profile or stored on or in the Service.</p>
            <p>(b) To the extent permitted by applicable law, waive all moral rights in the User Content which may be available to you in any part of the world and confirm that no such rights have been asserted;</p>
            <p>(c) Appoint Provider as your agent with full power to enter into any document and/or do any act Provider may consider appropriate to confirm the grant and assignment, consent and waiver set out above;</p>
            <p>(d) Warrant that you are the owner of the User Content and entitled to enter into these Terms and that the User Content does not infringe the proprietary or privacy rights of any third party;</p>
            <p>(e) Confirm that such User Content will not be subject to any obligation, of confidence or otherwise, to you or any other person and that Provider shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such User Content.</p>
            <p>(f) Agree and understand that your User Content is subject at all times to our Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
            <h2>6.  Deletion or Deactivation of User Content and/or your Account.</h2>
            <p>You may request that we delete resumes and cover letters by logging into your Account and clicking on the My Settings and "Resumes" or "Letters" tabs. Your User Content can only be completely deleted from public view by deactivating or deleting your Account by going to your Account and clicking the My Settings tab  . When you request that your public User Content be deleted, your resume or profiles will no longer be visible to other users within the Service, but if your User Content, including your information, was previously accessed, stored, and/or copied by others, we are unable to delete the information from their systems. When you deactivate your Account or ask that we delete your User Content we will retain logs and non-personally identifiable information about you along with an archival copy of your information, which is not accessible by you or third parties within the Service but which might be used for recordkeeping and internal legitimate business purposes. If you terminate your Subscription, you will still be able to use your login credentials as a Registered User to access and view the documents uploaded on your Account. This information will be available to you if you have an Account open. If you wish to close your Account and delete your data from our systems, you can do so by clicking here  or by contacting our Customer Service team.</p>
            <p>You further understand that Provider may keep and use data in various ways as outlined in these Terms and in the Privacy Policy. If you request that your User Content be deleted by us, it will no longer be publicly available and to the extent permissible by law, we will take all reasonable steps to delete it. Provider has no obligation to maintain any Account you open and may delete it if you violate these Terms as determined in Provider’s sole and absolute discretion (please see also our Acceptable Use Policy).</p>
            <p>Provider does not endorse any User Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Provider expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content towards third parties in the event of a violation of these Terms or in the event of illegal activities, contrary to decency, violating the interest of Provider or personal rights of third parties. Should Provider remove the User's Account, blocks access to the Site or cease to provide the Services to the User as a result of the above-mentioned violations, all fees paid by the User are not refundable. The Provider is not liable for damages resulting from the events described above. Provider does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service, and Provider will remove User Content if properly notified that such User Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights (please refer to our Copyright and Intellectual Property Infringement Notification Section). Provider reserves the right to remove User Content without prior notice.</p>

        <p>We provide resume and curriculum vitae building services and tools. In addition, our “Resume Posting Services” may facilitate the posting of your resume or a career profile on various third-party sites. If you sign up for our Resume Posting Services, you agree that we will use proprietary web-based information gathering tools to create a career profile for you. You further agree that the wording and interpretation of your information for purposes of Resume Posting Services will be in our sole discretion, and we will not be liable for any decisions to include, not include or phrase information about you as part of the Resume Posting Services. You understand, and consent to, that prior to posting your career profile or resume on a third-party career site, Provider will be accepting terms and conditions of use and privacy policies, and other policies that it might be prompted to accept, on these third-party sites.  By using our Resume Posting Services you're accepting full and total responsibility for the actions Provider performs on your behalf and at your request as if you had performed those actions yourself. You further acknowledge and agree that you will take full responsibility and are personally liable for any consequences arising from your use of the Resume Posting Services.</p>
        <p>Provider may also offer job posting and resume submission features as part of the Service in certain locations or jurisdictions. These features may be used only by individuals seeking employment and/or career information. In the same vein, certain Provider services may only be used by employers seeking employees.</p>
        <p>Depending on your location or jurisdiction, Provider may provide job alerts or may use third parties and automated search engines to provide job alerts, matching employment opportunities found on third-party job searching sites with your resume or career profile, job search requests submitted by you, and/or other usage data relating to your use of the Service. Provider tries to match the information available to ensure employment opportunities presented to you in job alerts match the type of career opportunities desired by you but Provider makes no guarantee that you will receive career opportunities or the job alert leads you desire.</p>
        <h2>B. Resume Parsing</h2>
        <p>Provider may also offer additional services that may help you in your application process, such as tracking your resume and facilitating the transfer and interpretation of your resume data by the third-parties involved in your application process (“Resume Parsing”). Upon downloading your resume, you agree that Provider may include a metadata and an identifier into your resume and share it with third-parties such as parsing companies, applicant tracking systems (ATS), and employers for the purpose of facilitating your application process and allowing such third parties, through technology, capture your data, process it, and deliver it to the prospective employer to whom you have submitted a job application.</p>
        <p>To see if the link on you resume has been clicked, please go to your Resume Analytics pannelpanel in your Account. Your Resume Analytics pannelpanel may give you data regarding your Resume Parsing activities, which may include (when available) the number of times your resume has been ‘parsed’, dates, and location. Note that all of this information may not always be available. Due to privacy, we may not be able to give you the name of the person, entity or third party who is parsing your resume, unless such person agrees to disclose its name. We do not guarantee the accuracy of the information on your Resume Analytics pannelpanel, nor the time or the location displayed on your Resume Analytics pannelpanel, as some people may be using blockers or VPNs to avoid tracking technologies such as the one in your Resume Parsing service. Each time the third party performs a parsing function over your resume, such activity will be automatically featured on the Resume Analytics pannelpanel and will show the user with the total number of parsing activities for your unique downloaded resume, which carries a specific document id. Your resume may be parsed multiple times within a single application process. Therefore, note that the number of parsing activities in your Resume Analytics pannelpanel may be triggered by the same third party and may not be indicative that different third-parties or employers have parsed or viewed your resume. You may download multiple resumes to capture a unique ID on each one enabling you to track the activities of each of such resumes.</p>
        <p>We may also enable a notification system to notify you when your resume has been parsed, which we may do by email or text, should such service become available. Such notifications shall be made (when available) under the terms and conditions contained herein applicable to notifications to our Subscribers. You acknowledge that the actual time between a parsing activity over your resume and the time the notification is sent to you depends on a number of factors, including your wireless service and coverage within the area in which you are located at that time, and that such notices may be delayed, experience delivery failures, or face other transmission problems. Email notices may be affected by Internet outages and other problems impacting the transmission and receipt of email messages. Additionally, and if you choose to download a word version of your resume, we will be able to notify you through the Resume Analytics   page each time such document is opened. This security functionality allows you to not only make sure you can track how many times your word document has been opened, but also from where. Note this information may not always be accurate as some people may be using blockers or VPNs to avoid tracking technologies such as the one in your Resume Parsing service.</p>
        <p>You may always opt-out of the Resume Parsing services and from receiving these notifications. To opt-out please visit your Resume Analytics pannelpanel or contact customer service. The Provider makes no guarantee that you will receive career opportunities or that the notices of Resume Parsing services will meet your requirements.</p>
        <p>Please remember that the Resume Parsing services will only become available if you download the resume from this Site and share your resume with third parties as part of your application process. The Resume Parsing service and any corresponding notice is not triggered by Provider and is only triggered upon your direct sharing of your resume with third-parties that are enabled with the parsing technology necessary to process the Resume Parsing services. That said, note that not all employers nor ATS are equipped with Bold’s proprietary technology and therefore, you will only receive notice only from those employers and ATS that have the Resume Parsing technology integrated in their systems. Our Resume Parsing technology accuracy will be dependent on the capabilities of the technology that the third-party has enabled in their systems to upload and read your resume. Therefore, Provider cannot guarantee that these third-parties receiving your resume will have the capabilities necessary to enable a 100% accuracy when processing your resume. By sharing your resume with third parties, you do so at your own risk.</p>
        <h2>C. Digital Resume and public Resume Database</h2>
        <h2>1. Digital Resume</h2>
        <p>Provider may offer digital resume services that allow you to create an online digital resume (“Profile”) using either your existing resume data or by creating a Profile from scratch using our proprietary builder which, once published, will be available online and part of our online public digital resume database.  Take advantage of this tool by creating multiple resumes and including unique web address identifiers ("Digital Resume IDs") for each one; that way, you can keep better track of who has viewed your Profile and see the details on your Analytics page.</p>
        <p>If you create a Profile, you agree that we will use the information you provide us to create a digital version of your resume, which once you agree to publish it, will be publicly available. Third parties may get access to your Profile by multiple routes, either by your direct sharing of your Profile link, by performing searches in publicly available search engines, such as Google, Bing, or through our publicly available resume database. Provider will not be responsible for claims or takedowns of your Profile if it’s featured on a third party site, since we do not have control over that content.</p>
        <p>When you create your Profile you also agree to have your data transferred to any of our affiliate websites or third parties. This will enable us to provide you with our services and, as part of it, make your profile more visible. Visit your Settings  page at any time to change your privacy preferences.</p>
        <p>Your Resume Analytics panel will give you all the data regarding your Profile, which may include (when available) the number of visits, visit dates, location of the visitor, source, and the number of contact requests received in the last 30 days. Note that all of this information may not always be available. If you search for a Profile, the Profile owner may be able to see your name in the Analytics panel and your general location (i.e. city and state).  We do not guarantee the accuracy of the information on your Analytics panel, nor the location of the person looking at your Profile, as some people may be using blockers or VPNs to avoid tracking technologies such as the one in your Profile. Also, each time a third party visits your Profile, the visit will be automatically featured on the Analytics panel and will provide the user with the total number of visits grouped based on the following characteristics: source, country, city, and timestamp. If the "Include your Digital Resume link" option is enabled for a specific resume, the visits that get attributed to each link will be featured on the resume Analytics panel, along with the Digital Resume unique ID they came from. By default, when your Profile gets published you will be given a web address with a unique identifier that will allow us to track and gather the above data, your resume will then be automatically made part of our resume database. This tool will help your Profile get more visibility. However, and although we do our best efforts to provide you with accurate information, we do not guarantee the accuracy of any of the above tracking data or statistics displayed on your Analytics panel.</p>
        <p>Your Profile will include the information you provided and agreed to publish, as well as a contact form that enables anyone  to request to contact you. WE WILL NOT DISCLOSE YOUR CONTACT DATA TO ANY THIRD PARTIES. However, we have no obligation to pre-screen information provided by you, this means that if you decide to include your contact data in any section of your Profile, it will be published and publicly available to everyone. Each time a third party visits your Profile and issues a contact request, we will send you an email notification with the contact data and message left by the third party (“Sender”). If you choose to continue the communications with the Sender, you do so entirely at your own risk. Your communications with the Sender are not under Provider's control, and you acknowledge that the Provider is not responsible for any aspects of the content/information you receive from the Sender. </p>
        <p>If you elect to use our digital resume tool, you understand that (a) your Profile will be available for anyone, including third parties, and (b) your communication with such third-party will be at your own risk. The Provider does not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information you might be requested to give the Sender, and you irrevocably waive any claim against us concerning such communication and from the use of the Profile. The Provider makes no guarantee that you will receive career opportunities, or the job alert leads you desire, nor that the communications received from the Sender will meet your requirements. The Provider is not responsible for any messages or hyperlinks embedded in messages obtained from the Sender. Under no circumstances will Provider be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on the information from the Sender or your communication with the Sender. The Provider makes no effort to review any contact request from the Sender for any purpose, including accuracy, legality, or non-infringement.</p>
        <p>As Sender, you acknowledge that Provider has no obligation to pre-screen information provided by you through the contact form. However, Provider reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any information. By using the contact form on the Profile you are agreeing to these Terms, and you hereby provide your irrevocable consent to such monitoring.  You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of the information (including your name, surname, contact data) provided through the contact form.  As Sender, you are requested to provide true and accurate data in the contact form. You must not provide the data of an individual other than yourself. We will send a copy of the information provided in the contact form to your email address. If Provider pre-screens, refuses or removes any information provided through the contact form, you acknowledge that Provider will do so for Provider’s benefit, not yours. Furthermore, you understand that the Provider does not guarantee the user will respond to your contact request.</p>
        <p>You recognize that storing, distributing, or transmitting unlawful material could expose you to criminal and/or civil liability. You agree that you are responsible for all material or information you send. Furthermore, you are obliged to refrain from transmitting any commercial, advertising, or promotional materials, or use the digital resume for commercial purposes. We require that you do not provide any content that violates any law or may be considered to violate any law. You are obliged to abide by all the applicable law, as well as you agree to abide by these Terms, and in particular obligations set out in sec. 7 of these Terms. </p>
        <p>As part of creating your Profile, you may be offered an option to be featured on other Profiles that share some of the same qualifications, job experience, or titles “Similar Profiles”. You can change your preferences at any time, and we will no longer feature your Profile on other Profiles. We do not guarantee that you will be featured on any Profile. You can come back at any time to set your preferences. Please refresh your browser if you don't see your changes applied or contact our Customer Service team.</p>
        <p>ANY COMMUNICATION WITH THE SENDER WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS. PROVIDER GROUP (DEFINED IN SECTION 18) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE (DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, ACTUAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHERWISE) RESULTING FROM ANY USE OR MISUSE OF THE DIGITAL RESUME OR PROFILE. IF APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ALL OR ANY PART OF THE ABOVE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO APPLY TO YOU, THE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY TO YOU ONLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
        <p>Please note that the cancellation of your subscription will not result in the unpublishing of your Profile from the public resume database.    Your Profile may be removed by deleting your Account. You can manage your Profile privacy settings by logging into your Account. You can edit your Profile content and design within the constraints of the feature as well as manually publish and unpublish your Profile. Please note that with the Profile unpublishing, the contact form feature, as well as the tracking feature will be automatically disabled, and your Profile won’t be accessible to third parties . When you request that your Account be deleted, your Profile will no longer be visible on the public resume database. However, once your information is disclosed on Profile, it may have been already previously accessed, stored, and/or copied by others, and therefore, we are unable to delete the information from their systems. By sharing your Profile with third parties, you do so at your own risk. Once your Profile is published, we have no control over your publicly available data. </p>
        <h2>2. Resume Database</h2>
        <p>Provider may offer as part of the service publicly available searchable database to which anyone can have access. When you decide to publish a Profile you will be automatically included as part of the database and your Profile will be searchable by anyone unless you actively opt-out. We will not show your address, phone number, or email address unless you have agreed to make this information available. Provider is not obligated to make available any information on the Profile and can remove it at any time without notice. You can change your privacy setting at any time by logging into your account and clicking on My Settings. Provider has no control over how third parties will use the information publicly visible on the database and you agree to share it at your own risk. Our searchable database will provide aleatory results depending on the job title and location where potential employers are looking to hire. Results are based on a computer system that provides results that best match the words imputed on the search form. If you prefer to have your Profile private, please set your privacy preferences on your Settings page and we will remove your profile from all publicly searchable databases.</p>
        <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Provider and its officers, directors, employees, agents, distributors, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs or expenses, including reasonable legal fees, resulting from your use of Profile and its inclusion on our public resume database (or from your use of the Contact form if you are acting as a Sender).</p>

        <p>If you purchase any Services that Provider offers for a fee, either on a one-time or on a subscription basis, you agree that Provider’s third-party vendors may store your payment information. You also allow Provider, through such third-party vendors, to use your payment method on file to process your subscription recurring charges and to process un-scheduled purchase transactions made by you through the Site. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the services you order (including, without limitation, periodic fees for monthly or annual subscriptions, or any additional administrative charge that may be applied) as they become due plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. </p>
        <p>There are various services offered by Provider that are free and do not have a payment requirement.  These can be accessed by any Visitor or Registered User at any time.

Provider also offers free template examples that might be downloaded and modified at any time. Also, there are other career related content accessible by just browsing our Site as a Visitor or Registered User.. Other additional features may require a payment. </p>
        <p>Once your subscription is active, it will automatically renew as described on the offer page until you terminate the contract. The subscription fee is charged in advance, at the end of each billing period. Any recurring charge will be fixed at the price agreed to at the time of purchase. The specific billing terms for the services you order will be described on the offer or checkout page on the Site. Payment will be collected from the payment method chosen by you and provided by the User and found in your Account. Note that to avoid the unintended cancelation of your Subscription, certain credit card issuers may automatically notify us of any updates in your credit card and provide us the updated card details. This service is not controlled by Provider and your credit card issuer is solely responsible. </p>

You will be again notified of the billing terms and how to stop recurring billing on your transaction receipt. By signing up for Provider Services with recurring billing, you will be deemed to agree to those billing terms as described specifically on the Site.

The remaining balance will be charged on a separate transaction either to the same card or any other card on file.</p>
        <p>For un-scheduled purchases, such as individual resume downloads, prints or emails, when such purchases are available, you agree that the Provider will charge your payment method on file for each of such un-scheduled purchases, individually, at the time of purchase. Such individual transactions are final and therefore, if you want a new modified version of your downloaded, printed or emailed resume, it will require a separate purchase.</p>
        <p>
        Provider may offer certain premium services such as Resume Review, Resume Writing, Premium Career Report and Cover Letter Writing, which may not be included in the cost of Provider’s basic subscription services.

Your transaction may also be subject to foreign currency exchange fees assessed by your bank or card issuer. Provider is not responsible for any foreign currency exchange fees or surcharges and will not make any compensation or reimbursement for charges imposed by your bank or card issuer. Provider does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your Account or the applicable service, you authorize us to continue billing that payment method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. Your obligation to pay fees continues until you cancel your subscription. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.</p>

        <p>The Service may contain testimonials and opinions (“Testimonials”) by users of our services. These testimonials reflect the real-life experiences and opinions of such users.

For privacy purposes, photos or names added next to testimonials may not always represent the person giving the testimonial. The views and opinions contained in the testimonials belong solely to the individual user and do not reflect our views and opinions. We are not affiliated with users who provide testimonials, and users are not paid in cash or compensated for their testimonials unless the testimonial is part of an incentivized Invited Submission.</p>

        23. Governing Law.</h2>
        <p>Subject to provisions below, this agreement is subject to the laws of the State of New York (US).</p>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by the applicable jurisdiction, these Terms shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws applicable to the merchant outlet location that processed your payment. Therefore, for transactions processed by BOLD LLC, the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, shall apply. If your transaction was processed by Auxiliant S.à.r.l, the laws of Luxembourg shall apply. Accordingly, both parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New York or Luxembourg, which means that in order to assert your rights under these Terms of Use, you may bring an action in front of a court in New York or Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, If you are a U.S. resident, except as otherwise provided in this section or as otherwise required by law, these Terms involve transactions between the parties in interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 USC § 1-19 of the United States of America. Judgment upon any interim or final award shall be entered and confirmed in any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction. The substantive law of the State of New York (excluding its conflicts of law provisions) shall apply to all disputes and these Terms. If there is a difference between the Federal Arbitration Act and New York law, the Federal Arbitration Act controls. In any circumstances where the foregoing Terms permit the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York for such purpose.</p>
        <p>These Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p>
        <h2>24.  Binding Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.</h2>
        <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.  IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. </p>
        <p>Scope of the Arbitration Agreement.  You and we each agree that, except as provided below, any dispute, claim, or controversy relating in any way to or arising in any way out of the Terms, the Provider’s services, or the Provider’s products, including the Service, and any use (or lack of use) or access (or lack of access) thereto, or purchase from the Provider (collectively, “Dispute”)—irrespective of when that Dispute arose—whether based in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding individual arbitration, rather than in Court.  You and we thereby agree to waive any right to a jury trial, and agree that you and we may bring claims against each other only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.   “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.</p>
        <p>(a) Informal Dispute-Resolution Process.  Either party asserting a Dispute shall first try in good faith to resolve it by providing written notice to the other party, as specified below, describing the facts and circumstances relating to the Dispute (including any relevant documentation).  You must send any notice to legal@bold.com or to the U.S. mailing address listed in the “Contact Us” section of these Terms.  Any notice we send to you will be sent to the most recent contact information that you provide us.  If no such information exists or if such information is not current, we have no obligation under this section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, you and the Provider will attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute, though nothing will require either you or the Provider to resolve the Dispute on terms that either you or the Provider, in each of our sole discretion, find unacceptable.  Both you and the Provider agree that this Informal Dispute-Resolution Process is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before the initiation of arbitration against the other party.   </p>
        <p>(b) Arbitrating Disputes.  After the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process, any remaining Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms).  If arbitration before JAMS is unavailable or impossible for any valid reason, any Dispute remaining after the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process will be conducted by, and according to, the rules and regulations then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).  Either Party may initiate arbitration of a Dispute upon completion of the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process for that Dispute.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any and all Disputes arising out of or relating to the formation, existence, scope, validity, interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, or any part of it, or of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to, any claim (except as explicitly outlined below) that all or any part of this agreement to arbitrate or the Terms of Use is void or voidable.  If any party disagrees about whether any portion of this Section 24 can be enforced or whether it applies to the Dispute, the parties agree that the arbitrator will decide that Dispute.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action waiver contained in this arbitration agreement must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the class action waiver.  Both you and the Provider understand and agree that we are waiving our right to sue or go to court to assert or defend our rights, except as set forth below.</p>
        <p>Unless you and the Provider agree otherwise, including to conduct the arbitration by telephone or videoconference or to have the arbitrator decide the Dispute without a hearing, any arbitration brought by or against a User who lives in the United States shall take place in-person in the User’s hometown or in New York, NY, unless the arbitrator determines that a different location would better serve the convenience of the parties.  If you live outside the United States, any arbitration will take place in New York, NY.  </p>
        <p>Arbitration will be handled by a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and the Provider are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.</p>
        <p>(c) Exceptions.  Notwithstanding the arbitration agreement in this Section 24, you and the Provider agree that the following types of Disputes will be resolved in a court of proper jurisdiction, unless both you and the Provider agree to submit the Dispute to arbitration pursuant to the procedures in this binding arbitration agreement:</p>
        <p>(i) Disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as the action or proceeding is brought and maintained as an individual action or proceeding and not as a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding;</p>
        <p>(ii) Disputes or claims where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief (including public injunctive relief); or</p>
        <p>(iii) intellectual property Disputes.</p>
        <p>Any litigation in court of the foregoing types of Disputes (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in a federal or state court located within New York, NY, and you and the Provider each consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.  Regardless of whether the foregoing types of Disputes in this Exceptions provision are resolved by a court or pursuant to arbitration, you and the Provider agree that the Dispute is subject to the class action waiver provision set in this Section 24.</p>
        <p>(d) Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, the Provider will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible reimbursement as set forth below). </p>
        <p>Each party is responsible for his, her, their or its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, and the Provider will not pay your attorneys’ fees or expenses except to the extent ordered by the arbitrator.  For the avoidance of doubt, in cases where a statute give you the right to recover attorneys’ fees if you prevail, the arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees pursuant to that statute.  In the event the arbitrator determines the Dispute you brought to arbitration is, in whole or in part, frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse the Provider for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by the Provider that you otherwise would have been obligated to pay under the JAMS Rules. In determining whether a Dispute is frivolous, in whole or in part, the arbitrator may consider whether the Provider has offered you a full refund of the sum you paid to the Provider for services provided by the Provider or has otherwise offered full relief to you in relation to your individual claim. If the arbitrator, upon final disposition of the case, finds your Dispute was not frivolous, the Provider will reimburse any filing fees that you paid and were not otherwise reimbursed.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction.  </p>
        <p>(e) Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to:</p>
        <span style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
            <p>BOLD LLC</p>
            <p>City View Plaza II, Suite 6000</p>
            <p>Guaynabo, PR 00968</p>
            <p>United States of America</p>
        </span>
        <p>The notice must be sent to the Provider within thirty (30) days of your first agreeing to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms.  If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver provision, the class action waiver still applies.  You may not opt out of only the class action waiver provision and not also the arbitration provisions.  If you opt-out of the arbitration provisions, or if you opt out of both the arbitration and the class action waiver provisions, the Provider will also not be bound by them.</p>
        <p>(f) WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Provider each agree that any proceeding, whether in court or arbitration, to resolve any Dispute will be brought and conducted ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (“CLASS ACTION”).  You and the Provider AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION.  You and the Provider EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM (whether arbitration, court, or otherwise).  If the dispute is subject to arbitration, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION.  Further, you and the Provider agree that the ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION.  For the avoidance of doubt, the waiver of the right to bring claims in or otherwise participate in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding set forth in the class action waiver contained herein does not prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief in an individual capacity to the extent otherwise authorized by law.</p>
        <p>
        IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION.  If a court decides that the limitations of this Section 24(f) are deemed invalid or unenforceable, any putative class, private attorney general, or consolidated or representative action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration.</p>
        <p>(g) Miscellaneous. We will provide notice of any material changes to this binding Arbitration Agreement and/or class action waiver (which may be satisfied by updating these Terms of Use, unless not otherwise permitted by law), in which case you will have the right to opt out of the arbitration provisions and/or class action waiver within 30 days after such change, consistent with the terms above. Except as set forth above regarding the class action waiver provision, if any portion of these arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of these arbitration provisions. Other than with respect to the class action waiver, as set forth above, only the arbitrator is authorized to make determinations as to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this binding Arbitration Agreement, including whether any Dispute falls within its scope. </p>
        <p>
        In the event that the arbitration agreement and/or class action waiver in this Section 24 is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against us (except for actions in small claims court) may be commenced only in a federal or state court located in New York, NY, and you and the Provider each consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.  In the event any provision of these Terms of Use is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, you agree that, unless it materially affects the entire intent and purpose of these Terms of Use, the invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of these Terms of Use nor the remaining provisions herein (except as set forth above with respect to the class action waiver), and the provision in question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision.</p>
        <p>(h) Non-Us Residents: If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Site or these Terms, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of this Section 24(b) dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then, we have no obligation under this section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Provider and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the dispute, though nothing will require either you or Provider to resolve the Section 24(b) dispute on terms either you or Provider, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable. Nothing in this Section will prevent a party from pursuing their claims in Court or another complaint process.</p>
